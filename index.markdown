# Universal Liberty and Prosperity

Hi, I'm George Donnelly and I'd like to work with you to achieve universal liberty and prosperity.

You in? OK, let's get up to speed fast. Below is my information. Send me your about page to [me@georgedonnelly.com](mailto:me@georgedonnelly.com) and schedule a call [here](https://calendly.com/georgedonnelly/15min).

## Bio

I am a libertarian thinker, cryptocurrency entrepreneur and digital communicator resident in Medellín, Colombia. My goal is to facilitate the creation of a world where transnational commercial cooperatives and other forms of stateless governance play a leading role, and have supplanted the nation-state as the dominant mode of governance.

I have professional experience in Unix/Linux systems administration, digital marketing, sales, investment banking, teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL/TESOL), high-performance web application hosting and consulting, firearms safety, copywriting, multiple other forms of writing, cryptocurrency mass adoption, working for a DAO and founding startups & small businesses that leverage cutting-edge technology. 

I have a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Chicago. I am a fluent speaker of native-level Spanish. I have also studied and spoken Japanese and German.

I'm also a science fiction author, unschooling dad, aikidoka, former Chicago cabbie and Gandhian nonviolence enthusiast (satyagraha). My MBTI is INTJ. I have lived in Philadelphia (9y), Chicago (8y), Osaka (2y), Kobe (2y), Medellín (17y) and Bogotá (1y).

Whoopi Goldberg called me a terrorist on [national network TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYhGyLCZko) and CNN says I’m [intriguing](https://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/24/wednesdays-intriguing-people-35/).

I love to work with honest, transparent people who are on compatible missions.

My goal as a human being is to be entirely present in the moment and to always present my best self to whatever challenges reality brings my way, and to limit my downside from that.

## Bitcoin ABC

I am working to fund Bitcoin Cash protocol development as Business Development Manager at Bitcoin ABC, the independent development group that maintains the Bitcoin ABC full node software that mines almost 100% of Bitcoin Cash blocks.

"If I could summarize nonviolence in one word, it would be: Patience." - Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan

It gives them new self-respect; it calls up resources of strength and courage that they did not know they had. Finally it reaches the opponent and so stirs his [her] conscience that reconciliation becomes a reality." - Martin Luther King, Jr.

“When you have to make a choice and don’t make it, that is in itself a choice.” - William James

“Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back– Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one’s favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now.” - Goethe

"All greatness of character is dependent on individuality. The man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him, will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity." - James Fenimore Cooper

"Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will." - Frederick Douglass

"We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself." ~Lloyd Alexander

"Law in origin was merely a codification of the power of dominant groups, and did not aim at anything that to a modern man would appear to be justice" - Bertrand Russell


"It is we [the workers] who built these palaces and cities, here in Spain and in America and everywhere. We, the workers. We can build others to take their place. And better ones! We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth. There is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world here, in our hearts. [...] That world is growing in this minute." - Buenaventura Durruti


"The only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this - that it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot." - Lysander Spooner

"I am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or to speak, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; – but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest – I will not equivocate – I will not excuse – I will not retreat a single inch – AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead." - William Lloyd Garrison

"Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give the appearance of solidity to pure wind.” - George Orwell

"The State represents violence in a concentrated and organized form. The individual has a soul, but as the State is a soulless machine, it can never be weaned from violence to which it owes its very existence." - Mohandas Gandhi

"Man is free at the instant he wants to be." - Voltaire

"We need to decide that we will not go to war, whatever reason is conjured up by the politicians or the media, because war in our time is always indiscriminate, a war against innocents, a war against children. War is terrorism, magnified a hundred times." - Howard Zinn

"That man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest." - Henry David Thoreau

"A government that is ruthless about what it does to other people is also ruthless in what it does to our own people." - Howard Zinn

"History is important. If you don't know history it's as if you were born yesterday. And if you were born yesterday, anybody up there in a position of power can tell you anything. And you have no way of checking up on it." - Howard Zinn

"There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long as men have to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long as moral values are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from condemning a torturer, is to become an accessory to the torture and murder of his victims." - Ayn Rand

"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." - Isaac Asimov

"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion." - Henry David Thoreau

"I am done with great things and big plans, great institutions and big success. I am for those tiny, invisible loving human forces that work from individual to individual, creeping through the crannies of the world like so many rootlets, or like the capillary oozing of water, which, if given time, will rend the hardest monuments of pride." - William James

"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. To be your own man is a hard business. If you try it, you’ll be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself." - Rudyard Kipling

"Do the things you really want to do if you possibly can. Don’t wait for circumstances to be exactly right. You’ll find that they never are." - Rudyard Kipling
