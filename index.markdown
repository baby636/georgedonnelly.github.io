# Universal Liberty and Prosperity

Hi, I'm George Donnelly and I'd like to work with you to achieve universal liberty and prosperity.

You in? OK, let's get up to speed fast. Below is my information. Send me your about page to [me@georgedonnelly.com](mailto:me@georgedonnelly.com) and schedule a call [here](https://calendly.com/georgedonnelly/15min).

## Bio

I am a libertarian thinker, cryptocurrency entrepreneur and digital communicator resident in Medellín, Colombia. My goal is to facilitate the creation of a world where transnational commercial cooperatives and other forms of stateless governance play a leading role, and have supplanted the nation-state as the dominant mode of governance.

I have professional experience in sales, investment banking, teaching English as a Foreign language, high-performance web application hosting and consulting, firearms safety, copywriting, multiple forms of writing, blogging, cryptocurrency mass adoption, leadership, founding startups. I have a bacherlor's degree in history from the University of Chicago.

I'm also a science fiction author, unschooling dad, aikidoka, former Chicago cabbie and Gandhian nonviolence enthusiast (satyagraha). I am a fluent speaker of native-level Spanish. I have also studied and spoken Japanese and German. My MBTI is INTJ. I have lived in Philadelphia, Chicago, Osaka, Kobe, Medellín and Bogotá.

Whoopi Goldberg called me a terrorist on [national network TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYhGyLCZko) and CNN says I’m [intriguing](https://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/24/wednesdays-intriguing-people-35/).

I love to work with honest, transparent people who are on compatible missions.

My goal as a human being is to be entirely present in the moment and in always presenting my best self to whatever reality presents me with, and to not completely screw up my life.

## Bitcoin ABC

I am working to fund Bitcoin Cash protocol development as Business Development Manager at Bitcoin ABC, the independent development group that maintains the Bitcoin ABC full node software that mines almost 100% of Bitcoin Cash blocks. Bitcoin ABC is focused on scaling Bitcoin Cash to billions of daily users and 10,000 transactions per second.

We have a business plan and I am very interested to speak with Bitcoin Cash and cryptocurrency miners and businesses about how we can grow together. Email me at [george@bitcoinabc.org](mailto:george@bitcoinabc.org) or schedule a presentation of the Bitcoin ABC 2020 plan [here](https://calendly.com/bitcoinabc/bizplan2020) (priority given to BCH miners and businesses at this time).
